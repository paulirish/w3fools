        <p>
          We are passionate about the web, learning, and craftsmanship. We want you, as web designers and developers, to be successful in your careers. We feel, though, that W3Schools is harming the community with inaccurate information. Like any other authoritative educational resource, W3Schools should both hold itself to, and be held to, the highest standards.
        </p><p>
          We hope we can illuminate why W3Schools is a troublesome resource, why their faulty information is a detriment to the web, and what you <small>(and they)</small> can do about it.

          <ol>
            <li class="noaffiliation">
              W3Schools.com is <strong>not affiliated with the W3C in any way</strong>. Members of the W3C have asked
              W3Schools to explicitly disavow any connection in the past, and they have refused to do so. <!-- This fact is from conversations with W3C employees, but afaik it is not published publicly on the web. Sorry. :( -->
            </li>

            <li class="cert">
              W3Schools takes advantage of its visitors by selling
              <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cert/default.asp" rel="nofollow">worthless certifications</a>. No employers recognize
              or respect W3Schools certificates. Unlike Microsoft’s <abbr title="Microsoft Certified Professional (MCSE, etc.)">MCP</abbr>
              or Cisco’s <abbr title="Cisco Career Certifications (CCNE, etc.)">CCC</abbr>, W3Schools has absolutely
              no authority over the technologies for which they claim to provide certification. Unlike CompTIA’s
              ANSI/ISO accredited certifications, W3Schools has no support from governing standards bodies. In short,
              W3Schools certificates are a scam.
            </li>

            <li class="incorrect">
              W3Schools frequently publishes inaccurate or misleading content. We have collected several examples

          just append mdc to your search query.

              up-to-date. Today, they do not even allow you to submit corrections on a page. They should.

          <p>
            An oft-repeated mantra in OSS (and a critique we've already received) is that you shouldn't criticise something unless you're willing to put your money where your mouth is and build something better.  It's an admirable ethos, but not really applicable here.</p>
            <p>W3Schools has put a lot of effort into positioning itself at the top of search results and, despite our efforts (such as the
            <a href="http://promotejs.com/">PromoteJS</a> initiative), appears to be there to stay. Other, better resources already exist, but
            none of them are capable of overcoming the inertia that W3Schools has built up over the years.</p>
            <p>We believe it is W3Schools's
            responsibility to disseminate accurate information—and if they refuse, we hope that this document will help dissuade
            others from promoting or linking to W3Schools as an authoritative source of information.</p>

                    <p>
                      This is false. Browsers' default stylesheet define these elements as block-level with non-zero <code>margin-top</code>
                      and <code>margin-bottom</code> values. No newlines are added.

                    <p>
                      This is misleading. Many features that have existed for years in IE are just now being standardized by HTML5, e.g. <code>contenteditable</code>.
                      IE8 also already supports <code>localStorage</code>, which is an HTML5 feature.

                    <p>
                      This is blatantly false. Professional web developers abhor editors like FrontPage and Dreamweaver,

                      This is blatantly untrue. "Correctly" does not mean "try to guess and maybe get it right some of
                      the time", which is what actually happens, usually in different ways between different browsers.
                      There are a few elements, such as &lt;p>, which are explicitly stated in the HTML spec to have an
                      optional close tag, but most elements are not this way.

                      This is still wrong. The example uses <code>&lt;p></code> tags, which are one of the few exceptions where
                      a closing tag is optional.

                      important, because W3Schools apologists often claim that the reason W3Schools documentation is
                      wrong is because it is old—but this "content" is certainly not old, as the web storage API is
                      less than 2 years old.

                      are conspicuously absent.
                      In HTML-dialect HTML5, boolean attributes like <code>hidden</code> do not have a value.
                      Finally, instead of listing all five microdata attributes, only "item" and "itemprop" are

                      This is not true. A lot of attributes, standard events and more are missing. We've documented
                      some of these omissions above, such as the HTML5 video attributes and HTML5 common attributes,
                      but there are many other places that purport to be complete references on the W3Schools that
                      contain significant errors or omissions.

                      In older browsers, placing scripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> has a negative impact on page performance. Until the script
                      is done loading: 1) resources below the script are blocked from downloading 2) elements below the script are blocked from
                      rendering. So try to put scripts at the bottom of the page, when possible.

                      Technically&hellip; JavaScript is a trademark originally registered by Sun Microsystems and licensed to Netscape when the language
                      was new. Sun was acquired by Oracle, which now owns the trademark, and Netscape passed the license for the trademark on to Mozilla.
                      The language was eventually standardized under the creative name ECMAScript by the EMCA international standards organization to
                      avoid legal conflicts with the trademark owner. Similarly, Microsoft named its clone of JavaScript, JScript. Meanwhile, JavaScriptCore,
                      the implementation of ECMAScript in Apple's Safari, appears to be willing to take the chance, and Google's v8 is off
                      doing its own thing being awesome and breaking the mold, man.
                    </p>

                      The sentence talking about the id attribute on the <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> is confused. <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> need not be nested
                      in a <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code>. The description of <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> is pretty weak.

                    <p>
                      Again, there's no requirement for gradients to be defined within a <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code>.

                      They teach VBScript and state:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      When a VBScript is inserted into an HTML document, the Internet browser will read the HTML and interpret the VBScript.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      It implies it will work in all browsers. The doc says nothing about VB being a proprietary language.

                      I imagine there are over 9000 errors in their PHP stuff, but I knew I would find this very easily if I looked.

                      This is very misleading and will make your Database susceptible to trivial SQL Injection attacks.
